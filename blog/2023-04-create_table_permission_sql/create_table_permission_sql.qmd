While working on a code that writes data to SQL database, I ran into an issue where R gives me an error as below

::: {.callout-important}
Error: nanodbc/nanodbc.cpp:1691: 42000: [Microsoft][ODBC SQL Server Driver][SQL Server]CREATE TABLE permission denied in database 'Database_Name'.
:::

The problem here is that my user does not have the write permission to create tables in the database, since I was creating a new table. To fix this since I have access to the SQL Server and I am a sysadmin as well I can use SSMS (SQL Server Management Studio) or just run the SQL code in R.

```{sql}
USE TransitDB
GO
GRANT ALTER ON SCHEMA::DBO TO RW_User
GRANT CREATE TABLE TO RW_User
GO
```
