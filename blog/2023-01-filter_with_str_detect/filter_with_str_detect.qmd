To filter using str_detect, generally you can use the code as follows:

```{r}
#| label: setup
#| include: false
library(tidyverse)
```
```{r}
stringr::str_detect("ravi chowdhury", "ravi")
```

as we can see the it returns logical TRUE which means it was able to find the string, however str_detect is case sensitive as seen below:

```{r}
stringr::str_detect("Ravi Chowdhury", "ravi")
```

To fix this we can use regex function ignore_case

```{r}
stringr::str_detect("Ravi Chowdhury", regex("ravi", ignore_case = TRUE))
```
